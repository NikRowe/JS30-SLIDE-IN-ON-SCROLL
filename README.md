# JS30 Slide In On Scroll
Exercise 13 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

I was definitely in the category that this took some time to figure out, and coming up with this logic from scratch is still a stretch for me I think. 
Scroll effects are more and more popular whether animating images or other elements on the page or having an advertisement modal pop up upon reaching a certain point on the page, so it was nice to see a version of how to start doing some of that. 

For my bonus I added a secret message within the lorem ipsum text that will highlight upon scroll. Compounding with yesterdays tutorial, if the user types the hidden message without any spaces it will open up an email so you can contact me for work opportunities.
